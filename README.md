# Dijkstra-Algorithm
Find The Shortest Path Using Dijkstra Algorithm in C++

The Dijkstra method is a well-known algorithm for finding the optimum path in shortest-path 
search problems. The objective of this project is to create a program to find the shortest path 
between two points and find the time and length for robot from one point to another point.
Dijkstra's original algorithm found the shortest path between two given nodes, but a more 
common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source 
to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

## Application 
This program can apply on the drone or robot to find the shortest path between two points with the object detection (CV2 or tensorflow library) to detect the point or the line between few location.
